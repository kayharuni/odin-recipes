      <p>Muffins! Yum yum they make the perfect food to start your day off and golly jeez whizz does it taste even better when you add chocolate chips into the mix! Although, making this treat can seem like a daunting task but fret not this recipe will make you a chef in just lickity split that Gordon Ramsay will call you a muffin head (affectionately). Just trust us and our recipes and you'll be golden!</p>
      <p>They key to a perfectly domed muffin top is to blast the batter with heat when you first place it into the oven, and then let it finish baking in a slightly cooler oven. This will cause the steam in the muffins to rapidly release, making the muffin puff up rapidly and create that perfect dome. 425 degrees Fahrenheit is a great temperature to start your muffins in. After about 7 minutes, reduce the heat in the oven to 350 degrees F. Watch your muffins closely as they finish baking as ovens vary slightly so your cooking time may vary as well. Pull your muffins out as soon as they are golden brown on top.</p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong> This moist chocolate chip muffin recipe starts with milk.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Instead of butter, this recipe calls for a neutral oil (such as vegetable oil).</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg lends moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter together.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour gives the batter structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugars:</strong> You'll need white and brown sugars for this sweet recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking powder:</strong> Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the muffins, but it won't make them taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate chips:</strong> Of course, you'll need chocolate chips!</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Instructions</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Line a muffin tin with paper liners. Lightly grease paper liners with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, use a hand mixer to cream together butter and sugar, about two minutes.</li>
        <li>Beat in eggs until combined. Add in the baking powder, salt, and vanilla and mix briefly.</li>
        <li>Add in half of flour, mix with hand mixer until just combined, then add in the milk, stirring to combine. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl and add in the remaining flour until just combined.</li>
        <li>Add the chocolate chips to the batter and use a rubber spatula to gently fold them in.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter up amongst the 12 muffins. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Let the batter rest while the oven preheats.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Reduce the heat in the oven to 350 degrees after 7 minutes. Watch the muffins closely as cooking times may vary depending on your oven.</li>
        <li>Let muffins cool for 5 minutes in the pan before removing them and transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
